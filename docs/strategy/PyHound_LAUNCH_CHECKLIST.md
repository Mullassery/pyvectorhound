# PyHound — Launch Checklist & Final Summary

## Product Overview

**Name:** PyHound  
**Tagline:** "Hunt down retrieval problems. Fix them fast."  
**Core:** Rust (performance) + Python wrapper (DX)  
**License:** MIT (open source)  
**Category:** RAG/LLM Retrieval Diagnostics (NOT observability)  

---

## Market Validation ✅

### Problem Verified
- ✅ **Academic backing:** Research shows developers struggle to identify which RAG component failed
- ✅ **Industry consensus:** "Your RAG isn't ready until you can debug retrieval"
- ✅ **Real pain point:** Teams currently debug blind (manual parameter tweaking)
- ✅ **Market size:** Every team building RAG (rapidly growing market)

### Competition Assessment
- ✅ **No direct competitors:** No tool isolates components + gives plain English recommendations
- ✅ **Adjacent tools:** DeepEval (test-time), Phoenix/Arize (observability), Evidently (generic)
- ✅ **Clear differentiation:** PyHound = diagnostics; others = monitoring/evaluation
- ✅ **Market gap:** Clear white space for diagnostic-focused tool

### Name Validation
- ✅ **PyHound available:** Existing PyHound (code search) is different domain
- ✅ **No conflicts:** RAG/LLM community won't confuse with code search tool
- ✅ **Strong branding:** "Hunt down problems" messaging is clear

## Product Positioning ✅

### Core Value Proposition
> **"Know exactly what's broken in your retrieval. Fix it fast. Measure improvement by component."**

### Key Differentiators
1. **Component diagnosis** — Isolates which stage failed (embedding, vector, BM25, reranker)
2. **Plain English** — Actionable recommendations, not metrics
3. **Model comparison** — Side-by-side embedding/reranker evaluation
4. **Database-agnostic** — Works with Qdrant, Chroma, Pinecone, etc.
5. **Open source (MIT)** — No vendor lock-in
6. **Improvement tracking** — Shows what actually got better (with percentages)

### Positioning vs Observability Tools
- **NOT** a replacement for Phoenix, Arize, Helicone
- **IS** a complement: observability alerts, PyHound diagnoses
- **Fills gap:** Observability shows "something's wrong"; PyHound shows "here's why and how to fix it"

---

## Core Features ✅

### 1. Diagnosis (The Main Feature)
```python
from pyhound import Hound
hound = Hound(db="qdrant", endpoint="localhost:6333")
diagnosis = hound.diagnose(query="...", top_k=5)
print(diagnosis.hunt())  # Plain English report
```
- Identifies failing component
- Explains why in plain English
- Recommends fixes ranked by impact
- Works with any vector DB

### 2. Model Comparison
```python
comparison = hound.compare_models(
    model_type="embedding",
    candidates=["3-small", "3-large", "cohere-v3"]
)
print(comparison.report())  # Quality/cost trade-offs
```
- Side-by-side model comparison
- Quality vs cost analysis
- Pareto frontier (best budget, best value, best quality)
- A/B testing framework

### 3. Improvement Tracking
```python
improvement = hound.compare_metrics(before="2026-06-15", after="2026-06-20")
print(improvement.breakdown())  # What improved and by how much
```
- Before/after component breakdown
- Shows exactly what got better
- Percentage improvements per component
- Cost-benefit analysis

### 4. Quality Scoring
```python
scorer = hound.quality_scorer()
quality = scorer.score(embedding_vector)  # Isotropy, coverage, distinctiveness
health = scorer.corpus_health()  # Drift detection
```
- Real-time embedding quality metrics
- Corpus-level health monitoring
- Automatic drift alerts

---

## Implementation Plan ✅

### Phase 1: MVP (3-4 weeks)
**Focus:** Get diagnostics working with main vector DBs

Features:
- ✅ Embedding Inspector (database-agnostic)
- ✅ Plain English diagnostics
- ✅ Quality scorer (isotropy, coverage, distinctiveness)
- ✅ Model comparison (embedding + reranker)
- ✅ Drift detection

Supported DBs: Qdrant, Chroma, Pinecone (can add more later)

Python API:
```python
from pyhound import Hound
hound = Hound(db="qdrant")
diagnosis = hound.diagnose(query="...", top_k=5)
print(diagnosis.hunt())
```

Delivery: GitHub + PyPI (pip install pyhound)

### Phase 2: Retrieval Engine (6-8 weeks later)
**Focus:** Full retrieval platform for teams that want it

Features:
- Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + DiskANN + reranker)
- Embedding versioning (zero-downtime migrations)
- Deep PyHound integration

### Phase 3: Advanced (After Phase 2)
- Cost-quality optimizer
- Prometheus/Grafana export
- Cross-language bindings

---

## Installation Methods ✅

### 1. pip (Recommended)
```bash
pip install pyhound
```

### 2. uv (Fast package manager)
```bash
uv pip install pyhound
```

### 3. Direct download (curl)
```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/pyhound-ai/releases/latest/download/pyhound -o pyhound
chmod +x pyhound
./pyhound diagnose --query "..." --db qdrant
```

### Quick Verify
```bash
python -c "from pyhound import Hound; print('✅ Ready!')"
```

## Key Messages ✅

### For RAG/LLM Teams
> "Your retrieval is broken, but you don't know why. PyHound tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it."

### For Data/ML Ops Teams
> "Stop guessing about embedding models. PyHound compares them side-by-side and shows you the ROI."

### For Open Source Community
> "MIT-licensed diagnostic tool for the RAG stack. Database-agnostic. Fast. Written in Rust + Python."

---

## Risk Mitigation ✅

### Risk: "Why not just use observability tools?"
**Mitigation:** Clear positioning that we're diagnostic, not observability. Phoenix + PyHound is the ideal combo.

### Risk: "Market too small for another OSS tool"
**Mitigation:** Market validation shows teams are struggling with this. RAG is rapidly growing. First-mover advantage in diagnostics.

### Risk: "Name conflict with existing PyHound"
**Mitigation:** Existing PyHound is code search (different domain). No confusion in RAG space. Similar to "Apache Spark" and "Apache Kafka" existing in different domains.

### Risk: "Database-agnostic support is hard"
**Mitigation:** Start with 3 main DBs (Qdrant, Chroma, Pinecone). Can expand. Most teams use 1-2 DBs anyway.
